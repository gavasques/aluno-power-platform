"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2025","VyingForVine","-","-","They‚Äôre OK, but do have some problems‚Ä¶","For the price (about 13 bucks as of this review in May 2025), 100 of these is a good deal, and they have some good points (but also some issues).They are soft (don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd agree with the adjective ‚Äúluxurious,‚Äù however), and they separate from one another pretty easily.  However, they also tear fairly easily as well, so you need to be a bit careful with them (which is a lot to ask of a massage client).  Also, be aware that they are NOT elasticized: they‚Äôre just flat pieces of a woven type of fabric, so a face/head is what holds it in place.Other shortcomings: the idea that they are ‚Äúnon-sticking‚Äù is kinda ridiculous.  After a client‚Äôs been on this, face down, for a period of time, it‚Äôs almost inevitable that the cover is going to stick to their face when they raise their head out of the cradle/face hole to flip over.  Not a huge big deal, but not ideal, either.  Also, my guess is that the cutouts (center hole/slit) are done in one big stack, so there are lots of little shavings/fragment bits of the material (tiny little triangles) hiding in the pack.Thanks for reading; I hope that my review helps you out!",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JBKSKAJNA5MZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TQH7Y55","B0DRXMJJMD","Color: 100"

"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2025","Customer","-","-","Really soft material","These disposable face cradle covers are so soft against the skin. I tried them myself, with my face in the cradle, and was surprised at how soft they are.They fit the face cradle as expected and are pretty easy to put on and take off. You just give a yank on the old one, toss it, disinfect the cradle, and drape on the new cover. I usually use washable covers, but I think for my clients faces disposable is a better way to go. These disposable covers also go on and off faster than the washable ones that need to be tucked. I know it's not important, but I gotta say the heart shaped cutout is kind of cute.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMUS0W6UPIDAL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09TQH7Y55","B0DRXMJJMD","Color: 100"

Here‚Äôs the scoop:Pros: ‚Ä¢ So Soft! It‚Äôs like a cloud for your face - if clouds were made of 100% cotton. Seriously, my face feels like it‚Äôs getting a spa day. ‚Ä¢ Cradle Coverage Perfection! These things hug my cradle like they were born for it. No awkward gaps or tucks, they just snug right in! ‚Ä¢ Easy Clean-Up! I‚Äôll confess, I‚Äôve given ‚Äòem a rinse or two, and they‚Äôre holding up like champs. Sustainable? I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôm giving it a try!Cons: ‚Ä¢ Package Unwrapping Olympics: You know that feeling when you‚Äôre trying to take out one tissue and the whole box comes flying out? Yeah, that‚Äôs the only downside here. They‚Äôre a little too eager to party! ‚Ä¢ Wrinkle City After Wash: A little spa day of their own in the ironing department. It‚Äôs like they had a wild night out and need a little straightening up! ‚Ä¢ Bag, Not a Box: I mean, they‚Äôre great, but they deserve a fancier entrance. A box would feel like an upgrade from the humble bag.Final Thoughts:Stop letting make-up ruin your face cradles and get these today.These covers are a treat for my cradle, but if I had a wish, it‚Äôd be for some rubbery tie-downs. A little extra stability never hurt anyone! Still, these covers are a must-have for anyone serious about their massage game.

I refuse to use paper towels because I suppose they look unprofessional. They often stick to clients' faces and slide off. So I have been using the fitted ones, which are pretty expensive. I have been doing this for years, and not one client has seemed to notice. I decided to experiment and try these.WOW! These are much softer than the fitted ones with elastic. Although sometimes they do slide since they are not secured to the face cradle, it doesn't happen that often and clients are not as annoyed as I thought they would be. These are noticeably softer and thicker, and they are large enough to completely cover the face cradle. They feel luxurious.I recommend at least trying these once. I finally did, and I won't go back to the expensive, thinner and less soft fitted covers.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B4MU22NTJTHM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07HP8ZSJK","B07J1T6GQZ","Size: 200 Count"

Here‚Äôs the scoop:Pros: ‚Ä¢ So Soft! It‚Äôs like a cloud for your face - if clouds were made of 100% cotton. Seriously, my face feels like it‚Äôs getting a spa day. ‚Ä¢ Cradle Coverage Perfection! These things hug my cradle like they were born for it. No awkward gaps or tucks, they just snug right in! ‚Ä¢ Easy Clean-Up! I‚Äôll confess, I‚Äôve given ‚Äòem a rinse or two, and they‚Äôre holding up like champs. Sustainable? I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôm giving it a try!Cons: ‚Ä¢ Package Unwrapping Olympics: You know that feeling when you‚Äôre trying to take out one tissue and the whole box comes flying out? Yeah, that‚Äôs the only downside here. They‚Äôre a little too eager to party! ‚Ä¢ Wrinkle City After Wash: A little spa day of their own in the ironing department. It‚Äôs like they had a wild night out and need a little straightening up! ‚Ä¢ Bag, Not a Box: I mean, they‚Äôre great, but they deserve a fancier entrance. A box would feel like an upgrade from the humble bag.Final Thoughts:Stop letting make-up ruin your face cradles and get these today.These covers are a treat for my cradle, but if I had a wish, it‚Äôd be for some rubbery tie-downs. A little extra stability never hurt anyone! Still, these covers are a must-have for anyone serious about their massage game.

I refuse to use paper towels because I suppose they look unprofessional. They often stick to clients' faces and slide off. So I have been using the fitted ones, which are pretty expensive. I have been doing this for years, and not one client has seemed to notice. I decided to experiment and try these.WOW! These are much softer than the fitted ones with elastic. Although sometimes they do slide since they are not secured to the face cradle, it doesn't happen that often and clients are not as annoyed as I thought they would be. These are noticeably softer and thicker, and they are large enough to completely cover the face cradle. They feel luxurious.I recommend at least trying these once. I finally did, and I won't go back to the expensive, thinner and less soft fitted covers.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B4MU22NTJTHM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07HP8ZSJK","B07J1T6GQZ","Size: 200 Count"
